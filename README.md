How I will be grading...
• I will use Chrome's Toggle Device Bar for iPhone 12 Pro / SE in both the Landscape
and Portrait views.
• Remember, this is a mobile site so formatting and layout should reflect this; too much 
scrolling or whitespace will reduce your mark.
Other Requirements:
• Create a folder for this assignment.
• The index.html should be the only file in the assignment folder.
• All other files should be in sub-folders, for example:
• CSS sub-folder to include all CSS files
• images sub-folder to include all images
• js sub-folder to include all JavaScript files
• … 
• Be sure to include the viewport setting in the html files. 
• Use GIT to back up your assignment folder.
• The GIT backup file should have at least 5 commits.
